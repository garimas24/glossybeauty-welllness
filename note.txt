Based on the fonts used in the shared files, the style of the Glossy Beauty & Wellness Academy & Salon branding combines elegant serif and clean sans-serif fonts for different purposes:

Main Fonts
Usage	Approximate Font Style / Family	Typical Alternative
Logo/Branding	Elegant, Decorative Serif (serif with swash/ligature)	Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond, Cinzel Decorative
Headings	Bold Serif or Geometric Sans-serif, clean and strong	Merriweather, Lora, Montserrat, Poppins, Playfair Display
Body Text	Classic Sans-serif, modern and readable	Open Sans, Lato, Roboto, Source Sans Pro
Subheadings, Emphasis	Modern Sans-serif/Bold, all-caps	Montserrat, Raleway
Detailed Notes
The main “GLOSSY” brand and large headers use a serif/decorative serif font with gentle curves and moderate thick/thin contrast, similar to Playfair Display or Cinzel Decorative.

The supporting text beneath, menu items, and lists use modern sans-serif fonts for readability, echoing Montserrat, Lato, or Open Sans.

Handwritten/cursive accents (like "Professional Courses" or “Facilities”) use a brush or script font, similar to Pacifico or Dancing Script.

Recommendation for Website
For consistency and accessibility online, use these Google Fonts combinations:

Logo/Headings: Playfair Display, Cinzel, or Cormorant Garamond

Body: Open Sans, Lato, or Montserrat

Accent script: Dancing Script or Pacifico

This palette will closely reflect your printed material and ensure a clean, high-end appearance for your website.

If exact font matching is critical, uploading the font files or revealing the font names from the original design files will yield 100% accuracy. The above suggestions, however, are visually and stylistically very close to what is seen in your marketing and printed materials.
